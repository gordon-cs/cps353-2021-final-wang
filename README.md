I would like to create a Bible site that has the features of other Bible sites such as searching for single verses or whole chapters. Random verses can also be implemented using the Random button. It also has the ability to turn pages. I also have some other ideas like adding a commentary button with commentary, and getting the explanation of the verse through another website's API.
